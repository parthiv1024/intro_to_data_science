# Introduction to Data Science
## Overview
This is the code for the solution to Siraj Raval's first coding challenge on 'intro to data science'. This is a program that compares 4 different models on the task of classifiying the gender of a person based on their height, weight and shoe size
## Results
Decision Tree Classifier: 1.0  
Support Vector Machine Classifier: 1.0  
Naive Bayes Classifier: 0.8181818181818182  
Neural Network Classifier: 0.5454545454545454  
NOTE - For the MLP Neural Network the results kept changing but mostly they were alternating between 0.454545.. and 0.545454..
## Dependencies
Scikit learn - To install Scikit-learn run sudo pip3 install scikit-learn or sudo pip install scikit-learn
## Usage
Run using python3 <path_to_repository>/gender_classifier.py or python <path_to_repository>/gender_classifier.py
## Credits
The credits for the challenge and base code goes to Siraj Raval (||Source||)
